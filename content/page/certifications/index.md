Hugo theme Stack supports the creation of interactive image galleries using Markdown. It's powered by [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) and its syntax was inspired by [Typlog](https://typlog.com/).

To use this feature, the image must be in the same directory as the Markdown file, as it uses Hugo's page bundle feature to read the dimensions of the image. **External images are not supported.**

## Syntax

```markdown
### Test 1
![Image 1](1.jpg)
```

```markdown
### Test 2
![Image 2](2.jpg)
```

## Result

![Image 1](1.jpg)
